# GameEngine
GameEngine with OpenGL

Objectives: - Little OpenGL-Wrapper with abstraction (no OpenGL-Code in main() etc).
            - Should be easy to setup. Just a few lines to get the engine going and to render the first objects.
            - For learning purposes (don't expect enterprise-level code or structuring of the project - but I'm always open for improvement suggestions).
            - Don't download versions before the 25th commit otherwise you have to include OpenCV yourself.
            
Plans for future version: - Soundsystem with OpenAL
                          - Verticepicking maybe via Raycasting
                          - Improved Lighting
                          - AI
                          - Collisiondetection
                          - Animation
                          - Enhanced water quality
                          - Overall better graphics
                          - Improved performance via less rendercalls (maybe Instancing or Batchrendering)
